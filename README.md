brototype
=========

Bro, do you even write javascript?

## Features

You've got a deeply-nested set of objects that may or may not always be there.
We've all seen something like this:
`var myURL = app.config.environment.buildURL('dev');`
which leads to one of our favorite javascript errors...
`error: undefined is not a function`

And the solution only makes the code base ugly:
```
var myURL;
if (app && app.config && app.config.environment && app.config.environment.buildURL) {
    myURL = app.config.environment.buildURL('dev');
}
```

We all hate that, don't we?

So what if you could just type:
```
var myURL;
if (Bro(app).doYouEven('config.environment.buildURL')) {
    myURL = app.config.environment.buildURL('dev');
}
```

Or better yet, how about:
```
var myURL;
Bro(app)
    .iDontAlways('config.environment.buildURL')
    .butWhenIdo(function(val){
        myURL = val;
    });
```

Well, now you can!

## Features

### Testing nested members
```
if(Bro(object).doYouEven('lift')) {}
```
Or, just use a callback...
```
Bro(object)
    .doYouEven('property.subproperty', function(subproperty) {
        console.log(subproperty);
    });
```

### Fetching nested members
```
var value = Bro(object).iCanHaz('cheezeburger');
```

### Calling nested functions
```
Bro(object)
    .iDontAlways('method')
    .butWhenIdo(function(returnVal) {
        ...
    });
```

### Handling exceptions
```
Bro(object)
    .braceYourself('method.name')
    .hereComeTheErrors(function(e) {
        console.log('error ' + e + ' happened.');
    });
```

### Check for undefined
```
if (Bro(someVar).isThatEvenAthing() === Bro.TOTALLY) {
    // do stuff
}
```

### Get a sorted list of object keys
```
var keys = Bro(object).allTheThings();
```

### Extending objects
```
var obj1 = {foo: 'boo', bar: 'bar'},
    obj2 = {foo: 'bar', yes: 'no'};
Bro(obj1).comeAtMe(obj2);

// now obj1.foo == 'bar' and obj1.yes == 'no'
```

### Extending Brototype!
Yes, extend me, Bro!

```
var plugin = { foo: function() { whatever; }};
Bro.prototype.comeAtMe(plugin);
```
